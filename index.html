  <h1>Unconventions</h1>
  <p>It's ok to <em>not</em> follow common conventions.</p>
  <p>
    I know, I know, someone made a website! They told the world that everyone
    should do <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>,
    <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org">Conventional Commits</a>, and
    also they should <a href="https://keepachangelog.com">Keep a Changelog</a>.
    The website looks nice and the idea itself even has a version!
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, it's a convention. That's fine, and please follow it if you want to.
    Not everyone will follow it, and that's a good thing. That's how we get
    better conventions, for example. It's also fine to not be so serious, and
    sometimes do programming <a href="https://justforfunnoreally.dev">Just for
    Fun. No, really.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    So if someone comes to you and asks why you don't follow <em>&lt;insert
    convention here&gt;</em> you can say that you choose to follow
    "Unconventions, version 無限" instead.
