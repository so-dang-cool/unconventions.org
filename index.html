    <p>The forever-unconventional convention</p>

    <h2>Hey, you, internet person!</h2>
    <p>
      It's ok to <em>not follow</em> common conventions. A project that follows
      "unconventions" is choosing to opt out of one or more common conventions.
    <p>
    <p>
      Perhaps they use a more obscure convention, or no convention at all.
      Maybe it's all explained, and maybe it's not. Anyway, it's a valid
      choice.
    </p>
    <h2>But but but...!</h2>
    <p>
      Ok, I know, I know, someone made a nice website! They told the world that
      everyone should do <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>,
      <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org">Conventional Commits</a>, and
      also they should <a href="https://keepachangelog.com">Keep a Changelog</a>.
      The website looks polished, the idea sounds better than alternatives, and
      wow the <em>convention</em> itself even has a version! Everyone obviously
      has to adopt it and <b>we should flame the lazy bums that don't follow
      the rules,</b> right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>No.</b> Stop that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conventions are optional. They're fine if you like them, and often
      helpful if other people you're interacting with follow them. Not everyone
      will follow every convention that comes along, and hey, <em>that's a good
      thing!</em> Every new and good convention came about because someone was
      not following some older and worse conventions. (Of course: old ‚â¢ bad)
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also fine to not be so serious all the time, and sometimes do stuff,
      you know, "<a href="https://justforfunnoreally.dev">Just for Fun. No,
      really.</a>"
    </p>
    <p>
      If someone comes to you and asks why you don't follow <em>&lt;insert
      convention here&gt;</em> you can say that you choose to follow
      Unconventions. If they're persistent and ask for a version, you can say
      version ÁÑ°Èôê. All versions of unconventions should be considered the
      same version. Version "v1.0" and version "banana" are also the same as
      version ÁÑ°Èôê by convention.
    </p>

      Unconventions is not <em>against</em> conventions, but it carries a
      spirit that is willing to listen to, and amplify, well-meaning critiques
      of conventions. The following lists are intended to push conventions
      forward, either to improve or to foster discussion that leads to newer
      and better conventions.
